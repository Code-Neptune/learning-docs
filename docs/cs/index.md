# Computer Science Foundations

Computer Science is not just programming; it is the study of **computation**, **information**, and **automation**.

## Computational Thinking
Before writing code, we must solve the problem.

| Concept | Definition | Real World Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Decomposition** | Breaking a complex problem into smaller parts. | Cooking breakfast = (Make toast) + (Fry egg) + (Pour coffee). |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Finding similarities within problems. | All cars have wheels, engines, and steering. |
| **Abstraction** | Ignoring irrelevant details to focus on the core. | Using a map (ignoring trees/houses to focus on roads). |
| **Algorithms** | Step-by-step instructions to solve the problem. | A recipe for a cake. |
